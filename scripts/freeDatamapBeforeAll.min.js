LEGALESE:
---------

This is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and freeDatamap, for the proprietary freeDatamap code and all other files that are available for download at http://www.freedatamap.com (this code and documentation, as well as any updates which may at freeDatamap's sole discretion be provided to you from time to time, are referred to in this Agreement as "PROGRAM"). By downloading, copying, or otherwise using the PROGRAM, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not download or use the PROGRAM.

I. LICENSE

A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, freeDatamap hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable right to use the PROGRAM in apps, web sites, games, components and other software applications ("Developed Works") for which the end user is NOT charged any fees.
If you would like to use the code in a commercially licensed Developed Work for which end users are charged a fee (either for usage or access), simply sign up for the appropriate commercial freeDatamap License by asking at freedatamap@gmail.com.

II. LIMITATION OF LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS

A. You agree that you will not sell, rent, or license the PROGRAM's source code or any derivative works thereof to any third party without the prior written consent of freeDatamap. Distribution of the PROGRAM as part of your Developed Work is acceptable so long as it is used exclusively as a part of your Developed Work without any charge for the end user. You agree not to modify or delete freeDatamap's existing copyright notices located in the source code.

B. You may use, duplicate, and distribute the compiled object code as embedded in Developed Works created by you, either for your own use or for distribution to a third party so long as end users of the Developed Work are not charged a fee for usage of or access to any portion of the Developed Work.

III. CONSIDERATION

A. The license rights granted to you under this Agreement are at no charge, but only in the following circumstances: If on your own behalf or on behalf of a third party you incorporate the PROGRAM into a web site, app, game, program or any component thereof (collectively, "Developed Work"), which in the case of a web site, must be accessible to internet users without payment of a fee of any kind, and in the case of a software application, game, program or component, neither you nor anyone to whom you distribute the Developed Work charges a user a fee of any kind to use such Developed Work or application, game, program or component into which such Developed Work is embedded. The foregoing shall apply regardless of whether you are paid to create such Developed Work.

B. In the event your intended use of the PROGRAM does not meet the criteria for the "no charge" license rights set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, then you are not licensed to use the PROGRAM under this Agreement and must license the PROGRAM under freeDatamap's commercial license and ask freeDatamap for that at freedatamap@gmail.com.
